## Research compendium package for Kohler, Brumbaugh, and Bocinsky (2025)

This R-based research compendium supports an analysis of climate variability and its impact on ancestral Pueblo demography in the Chaco Regional System. It draws on high-resolution paleoclimate reconstructions and spatial regional boundaries to estimate the frequency and duration of agricultural potential over time, and their relationship to the demography of the region.

### Overview

The main script is [`kohler2025.qmd`](kohler2025.qmd) and output is written to [`kohler2025.html`](kohler2025.html). This is a Quarto markdown document that includes code to perform all analyses reported in the manuscript, as well as text descriptions of those analyses.

[`kohler2025.qmd`](kohler2025.qmd) performs the following steps:

1. **Load spatial boundaries** for Chaco and Mesa Verde subregions from GeoJSON.
2. **Access paleoclimatic precipitation reconstructions**, either from Amazon S3.
3. **Extract seasonal climate summaries** (e.g., water-year precipitation, summer growing degree days) for each region and year.
4. **Compute sliding window niche statistics**, identifying consecutive years of shortfall.
5. **Model pre-European net primary productivity** using the LightGBM framework.
6. **Export all figures tables** included in the 

_Note_: The script uses `AWS_NO_SIGN_REQUEST = "YES"` to access public climate datasets hosted on S3.

### ðŸ—‚ Directory Structure

- `kohler2025.qmd`: Performs all analyses and produces data, tables, and figures
- `data-raw/`: Directory containing un-processed datasets used in the analysis. Not archived on Github, as many of these data are quite large.
- `data-derived/`: Directory containing processed datasets created in the analysis.
- `figures/`: Directory containing figures used in the manuscript.
- `tables/`: Directory containing tabular data used in the manuscript.
- `README.Rmd`: This README file, providing an overview and usage
  instructions.
